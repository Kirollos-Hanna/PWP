## Meeting 2.
* DATE: 15.02.2023
* **ASSISTANTS:** Iv치n S치nchez Milara

### Minutes
*We discussed the database implementation for our e-commerce course project. Overall, the implementation was adequate. Some things that came up were the possible external services for API and we decided that either a recommendation service or a service providing images would be sufficient and relevant. Additionally, the user roles' implementation should be discussed further.*

### Action points
- add resource allocation
- add explanation to example site
- add explanation/comments to the code
- add relationships to code
- add possible nullability to table
- add larger str size for images in code
- add script to populate whole db
- elaborate on the installable libraries




## Meeting 3.
* **DATE:**
* **ASSISTANTS:** Iv치n S치nchez Milara

### Minutes
*We discussed our API implementation in detail and justified our choices for resource selection and routing. Furthermore, we used pytest, pytest --cov and pylint to our API and test file to ensure that the implementation worked. The tests performed well in functionality, but documentation of API was a bit lacking. Finally, the next action points were discussed.*

### Action points
- deleting should be for a collection, otherwise not rest
- api/products/reviews/<review:review>/
- api/categories/<category>/products/<product>/
-> so we can have two urls representing same product
- more info to resource description, what is a review, category etc
- minimizing the number of root resources
- remove DeleteAll
- every resource instance can have multiple urls
- explain http methods more, add examples
- explain setting FLASK_APP more
- missing a lot of docstrings, lines a bit too long
- which code did we implement, which was taken from course material (i.e converters)
- tests with xml request body, not json
- additional testing with pycov
- with PUT you need to send the whole object, otherwise it should be PATCH -> modify
- test also without caching
- implement authentication
