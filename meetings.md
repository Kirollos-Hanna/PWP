### Minutes
We discussed the database implementation for our e-commerce course project. Overall, the implementation was adequate. Some things that came up were the possible external services for API and we decided that either a recommendation service or a service providing images would be sufficient and relevant. Additionally, the user roles' implementation should be discussed further.
